## Getting Started

Vendas is a sales platform, which contains a REST API (`api`), developed with the PHP Laravel framework, Eloquent ORM, MySQL database, and, a Web Application (`app`) developed with the Vue.js, Vuex and Axios.

Since the `api` is responsible for the back-end, communicating with the database, the `app` is the front-end, communicating with the `api` and rendering the information for the user. In this way, for the web application to work correctly, the API must be running.

A local development environment is available to quickly get up and running. You will need a basic understanding of how to use the command line on your computer. This will allow you to set up the local development environment, to start it and stop it when necessary, and to run the tests.

You will also need Docker installed and running on your computer. Docker is the virtualization software that powers the local development environment. Docker can be installed just like any other regular application.
